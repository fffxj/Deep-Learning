# Deep Learning

These are the programming assignments
from [Coursera's Deep Learning Specialization][DL] taught by Andrew Ng provided
by Deeplearning.ai

In five courses, you will learn the foundations of Deep Learning, understand
how to build neural networks, and learn how to lead successful machine learning
projects. You will learn about Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam,
Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more. You will work on case
studies from healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading, music
generation, and natural language processing. You will master not only the
theory, but also see how it is applied in industry. You will practice all these
ideas in Python and in TensorFlow, which the specialization will teach.
